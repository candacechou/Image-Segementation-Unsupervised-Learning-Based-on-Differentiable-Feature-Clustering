## Image Segmentation using unsupervised learning

This repository is adapted from the following paper:

Wonjik Kim\*, Asako Kanezaki\*, and Masayuki Tanaka.
**Unsupervised Learning of Image Segmentation Based on Differentiable Feature Clustering.** 
*IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, accepted, 2020.
([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09990))

and one can see their own github repostory [here](https://github.com/kanezaki/pytorch-unsupervised-segmentation-tip/). 
The original code is written in Pytorch but I implemented it in Keras.
